    <h1>Privacy Policy for Ticket Cleaner</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 12, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Ticket Cleaner ("we," "our," or "us"). Ticket Cleaner is a privacy-first Android application designed to help you automatically detect and manage old flight tickets and boarding passes on your device. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our app.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Privacy-First Design</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Ticket Cleaner is designed with privacy as its core principle.</strong> All processing happens entirely on your device. We do not:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect, transmit, or store your personal data on any servers</li>
        <li>Upload any files or content to the cloud</li>
        <li>Share your data with third parties</li>
        <li>Track your usage or behavior</li>
        <li>Use analytics or advertising services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Permissions and Data Access</h2>
    <p>
        To function properly, Ticket Cleaner requires the following permissions:
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 Storage Permissions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</strong> (Android 11+): Required to scan files across all directories in your device's internal storage to find flight tickets and boarding passes.</li>
        <li><strong>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</strong> (Android 10 and below): Required to access files in your device's internal storage for scanning.</li>
        <li><strong>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</strong>: Required to move files to the trash bin when you choose to delete tickets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The app only accesses your device's internal storage. External SD cards are not scanned.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How we use these permissions:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We only scan PDF and image files (JPG, PNG, etc.) from your device's internal storage</li>
        <li>Files are read locally on your device for ticket detection</li>
        <li>Files are never modified without your explicit action</li>
        <li>Files are only deleted when you choose to delete them</li>
        <li>All scanning and processing happens entirely on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Notification Permissions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</strong>: Used to notify you when background scans find new flight tickets or boarding passes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Ticket Cleaner stores the following data locally on your device only:
    </p>

    <h3>4.1 Scan Results Database</h3>
    <p>
        We maintain a local database on your device that stores:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information about scanned files</li>
        <li>File modification information</li>
        <li>Scan history</li>
        <li>Flight information if detected</li>
        <li>File metadata</li>
        <li>Your preferences (e.g., files marked as "not a ticket")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is used to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficiently scan your files without unnecessary re-processing</li>
        <li>Display scan results in the app</li>
        <li>Remember your preferences</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 Trash Bin</h3>
    <p>
        When you delete a ticket, it is moved to a trash bin stored locally in the app's private directory. Trash items are automatically deleted after 30 days. You can restore deleted items from the trash bin before this automatic cleanup.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 App Settings</h3>
    <p>
        The app stores app preferences and settings locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
        All data processing happens locally on your device. The app uses on-device text recognition and pattern matching to detect flight tickets and boarding passes.
    </p>
    <p>
        No files, images, or extracted text are ever sent to external servers or services. All processing is done entirely on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not share your data with anyone.</strong> All data remains on your device and is never transmitted, uploaded, or shared with third parties, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics services</li>
        <li>Advertising networks</li>
        <li>Social media platforms</li>
        <li>Any other third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scan Results:</strong> Stored locally until you uninstall the app or manually clear app data. You can also manually mark files as "not a ticket" to exclude them from results.</li>
        <li><strong>Trash Bin:</strong> Deleted items are automatically removed after 30 days. You can also manually restore or permanently delete items from the trash bin at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>On App Uninstall:</strong> All app data, including the database, trash bin, and preferences, is automatically deleted by Android when you uninstall the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
        While Ticket Cleaner processes your data entirely on your device, we recommend:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keeping your Android device updated with the latest security patches</li>
        <li>Using device lock screen protection</li>
        <li>Being cautious about granting storage permissions to any app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Ticket Cleaner is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since we do not collect any personal information, this is not applicable, but we include this notice for completeness.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can revoke permissions at any time in Android Settings</li>
        <li>You can delete the app to remove all data</li>
        <li>You can clear app data through Android Settings</li>
        <li>You can manually delete files from the trash bin</li>
